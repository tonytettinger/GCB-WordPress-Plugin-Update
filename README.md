# Update for the Global Content Blocks (GCB) WordPress plugin

## Issue

The GCB plugin became unsupported and was taken down from the WordPress plugin directory as of September 2016. 
This is allegedly mainly because of a Cross-Site Request Forgery security vulnerability. 
The second issue with the plugin is, that it saves the data into the options table, which makes the data disappear if we use WordPress Multisite and saving as a network administrator.
